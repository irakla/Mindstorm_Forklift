# Mindstorm_Forklift

It coded by NXC for utilizing a Mindstorm grabber.<br/>
Action is simple. If the sensor boarded on eye position detects something close, the grabber will grab that and go some distance, and throw it..

It made for the results of Base Architecturing class in my CSE barchelor course.
